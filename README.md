## Scope and Purpose

This document attempts to replicate the source material and present it in a more 
accessible structure.

As the source material is freely available online and the cost of a print version 
of this text is prohibitively high, I believe this document is an important 
contribution to the collective knowledge of potters. 

It improves upon the HTML version of the information by consolidating all sections 
into a single document, which is both viewable on the computer and can also be
printed. Furthermore, it introduces clickable links/references between sections and 
tables.

## Potential Errors, Omissions

I have attempted to preserve the original text and formatting. 

Some changes to formatting, especially of tables, was unavoidable due to the 
LaTeX typesetting.

Some corrections were made to spelling and grammar.

Unfortunately, no images are available in the online version of this document. 
Inline references to images have been maintained, but will always appear as 
**??**. Appendices are also missing.

The possibility of minor or unavoidable changes in layout and formatting, as 
well as unintentional errors in transcribing the original text, cannot be 
excluded.
