\chapter*{Preface}
This book is the second in a series of books for potters and ceramists working 
in developing countries. 

The term ``self-reliant potter'' is the common name for the series and this 
reflects the condition of potters in many developing countries. Imported 
materials and equipment are seldom available, and the supply of raw materials 
within a country is often difficult.

Self-reliance is therefore a practical approach to ensure profitable pottery 
production under such conditions.

The book is mainly directed to:
